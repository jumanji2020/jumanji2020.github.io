Physics is an experimental science and, while it is true that progress in
physics has always relied on the contributions of theorist, the
ultimate test of their theories takes place in the laboratory. The
experiments in this course cover most of the topics you will
encounter in your lecture course. They will be invaluable as an aid
to deeper, conceptual understanding of those topics. Fundamental laws
and relationships will be put to the test and (hopefully) verified.
The meaning of an equation will be clarified so that it is not merely
a collection of symbols. You will learn the use of several
instruments, and how computers can be interfaced with physics
experiments.
